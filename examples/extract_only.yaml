  - name: Extract Audio
    module: extract
    parameters:
      # Input: Video file to process
      # Can be specified in three ways:
      # 1. Via CLI using -i flag: studioflowai run -w extract_only.yaml -i ./input/video.mp4
      # 2. In the workflow file (as shown below)
      # 3. From a previous step's output in the workflow
      input: "./input/video.mp4"                     # Video file to process (REQUIRED - replace with your video path)
      # Output: Audio file in output directory
      outputFileName: "audio"                        # Will create audio.wav in output directory
      outputFormat: "wav"                           # Output audio format (wav, mp3, etc.)
      ffmpegParams: "-ac 2 -ar 44100"               # FFmpeg parameters for audio extraction

# Example usage:
# 1. Using CLI input:
#    studioflowai run -w extract_only.yaml -i ./input/video.mp4
#
# 2. Using workflow input parameter:
#    studioflowai run -w extract_only.yaml
#
# 3. As part of a larger workflow:
#    - First run this workflow to extract audio
#    - Then run the transcribe module to get transcript
