  ## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. COMPLETE COVERAGE: Analyze the ENTIRE transcript to the END. NEVER STOP early.
  2. SPANISH OUTPUT: Generate ALL content (titles, descriptions, tags, short_title) in SPANISH for Spanish-speaking audiences.
  3. TOPIC IDENTIFICATION: Identify all main topics/themes discussed in the video.
  4. MINIMUM CLIPS PER TOPIC: Create AT LEAST 3 shorts for EACH identified topic.
  5. DISTRIBUTION: Ensure clips are distributed evenly across beginning, middle, and end.
  6. DURATION: Each clip should be between %s and %s seconds.
  7. YAML FORMAT: Use EXACTLY the format shown in the example - respect indentation with spaces.

  ## REQUIRED YAML FORMAT (USE EXACTLY THIS FORMAT):
  ```yaml
  sourceVideo: ${source_video}
  shorts:
    - title: "Título atractivo"
      startTime: "hh:mm:ss"
      endTime: "hh:mm:ss"
      description: "Descripción detallada que explica por qué este momento es interesante"
      tags: "Hashtag1, Hashtag2, Hashtag3"
      short_title: "¿Pregunta o descripción corta que se responde en el video?"
  ```

  ## YAML SAFETY GUIDELINES (VERY IMPORTANT):
  - RESPECT the INDENTATION exactly as shown in the example (two spaces)
  - Use quotes for text with special characters like : or -
  - Avoid line breaks within values
  - DO NOT INCLUDE COMMENTS like "# Maximum 40 characters" in your final response
  - VERIFY that your YAML is valid before submitting
  - short_title: must be no more than 40 characters, try to be creative and interesting
  - title: must be maximum 100 characters including high impact hashtags between the name using #hashtags format

  ## SELECTION CRITERIA (at least TWO):

  3. Do you have AT LEAST 3 shorts for EACH identified topic?
  4. Is the YAML format EXACTLY as shown in the example?
  5. Does the indentation use TWO SPACES (not tabs)?
  
  ## IMPORTANT: Your response MUST begin with the required YAML format, without prior explanations.
