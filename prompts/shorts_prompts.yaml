prompt: |
  ## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  1. COMPLETE COVERAGE: Analyze the ENTIRE transcript to the END. Stopping early is NOT acceptable.
  2. SPANISH OUTPUT: Generate ALL content (titles, descriptions, tags) in SPANISH for Spanish-speaking audiences.
  3. DISTRIBUTION: Include AT LEAST 1 clip per 5 minutes of video. Distribute evenly across beginning, middle, and end.
  4. YAML FORMAT: Use EXACTLY the format shown in the example - respect indentation with spaces.

  ## PROCESS:
  1. Scan the entire transcript and note the final timestamp
  2. Identify high-impact, memorable moments that work as standalone clips (%d-%d seconds)
  3. Distribute your selections throughout the video (⅓ in each section)
  4. MANDATORY: Include at least 1 clip from the final 25% of the video

  ## REQUIRED YAML FORMAT (USE EXACTLY THIS FORMAT):
  ```yaml
  sourceVideo: ${source_video}
  shorts:
    - title: "Título atractivo"
      startTime: "00:15:30"
      endTime: "00:16:05"
      description: "Descripción detallada que explica por qué este momento es interesante"
      tags: "#Hashtag1, #Hashtag2, #Hashtag3"
  ```

  ## YAML SAFETY GUIDELINES (VERY IMPORTANT):
  - RESPECT the INDENTATION exactly as shown in the example (two spaces)
  - Use quotes for text with special characters like : or -
  - Avoid line breaks within values
  - DO NOT INCLUDE COMMENTS like "# Maximum 40 characters" in your final response
  - VERIFY that your YAML is valid before submitting

  ## SELECTION CRITERIA (at least TWO):
  - Hook factor: Captures attention in first 3 seconds
  - Viral potential: Motivates sharing/commenting
  - Emotional impact: Generates strong emotional response
  - Clear value: Offers specific insight or useful teaching
  - Self-contained: Understandable without additional context
  - Quotable: Contains memorable phrase for text overlay
  - Complete story: Mini-narrative with beginning, development, conclusion
  - Unique perspective: Surprising or uncommon point of view

  ## MANDATORY FINAL VERIFICATION:
  1. Did you analyze the COMPLETE transcript to the end?
  2. Do you have clips from the beginning, MIDDLE AND END?
  3. Are at least ⅓ of clips from the last third?
  4. Is there at least one clip from the last 25% of the video?
  5. Is the YAML format EXACTLY as shown in the example?
  6. Does the indentation use TWO SPACES (not tabs)?
  
  ## IMPORTANT: Your response MUST begin with the required YAML format, without prior explanations.
